    %h3 E-Cycling Important Notes
    %p Our E-waste event provides all donated electronics to PC Recycle (Bellevue, WA). PC Recycle refurbishes computers for resale to the extent possible. All computer-TV-monitor wastes are sent through the Washington Dept. of Ecology E-Cycle program where the waste is processed in Washington. For other wastes, PC Recycle sends metal wastes to a Washington company for refining, and other material goes to a company that participates in the “R2 Certification” and “EStewards Certification” programs, where most waste is processed in the U.S. The R2 Certification restricts waste processing to participating countries/facilities with environmentally and socially responsible practices for waste handling. PC Recycle is conscious of the concerns about downstream waste handling practices, as are their large business customers where many have downstream waste tracking requirements.

    %p Computer memory drives are professionally destroyed or, with your authorization, “scrubbed” for refurbishing and resale. Smart phone memory is wiped and the device refurbished; older/broken phones are sent to a certified refiner. We recommend that owners remove and destroy all flash drives (USB, SD cards, etc.) prior to recycling.

    %p Please do not bring loose batteries or items containing gas.
